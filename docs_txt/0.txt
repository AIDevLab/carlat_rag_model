
ADHD Medications
GENERAL PRESCRIBING TIPS
Generally, when you have a patient with ADHD symptoms, your /f_irst choice will be one of the psychostimulants, 
because these are usually more eﬀective than the alternatives—atomoxetine, bupropion, clonidine, guanfacine, and 
viloxazine. Which psychostimulant will you choose? Here are some of the factors that will in/f_luence your decision:

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
1. Long-acting vs short-acting.  Choosing between long- and short-acting stimulants is more art than science. Trial and 
error, combined with patient preference, will dictate the /f_inal regimen. Adults will often start with a long-acting 
agent so they can take a single dose in the morning and have it carry through their workday. Kids may do better 
with short-acting stimulants so that they will have an appetite when the medication wears oﬀ at lunch.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
2. Amphetamines vs methylphenidates.  More recent data have suggested that, based on safety and eﬃcacy, 
methylphenidates are a better choice in kids and adolescents whereas amphetamine-class agents are better 
in adults. Generally, this is a Coke vs Pepsi decision—some people like one better than the other, and you can’t 
predict their preference ahead of time. We recommend a methylphenidate over an amphetamine because 
amphetamines may have more side eﬀects and are more likely to be abused or diverted, but our algorithm starts 
with an amphetamine /f_irst given the eﬃcacy data.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
3. Stimulants vs non-stimulants.  Stimulants are more eﬀective than non-stimulants, so they will be your /f_irst-line 
choice for most patients. If you have a patient with a substance use disorder, start with atomoxetine. Some 
special clinical circumstances seem to naturally call for other options. For example, bupropion is helpful for ADHD 
symptoms, as well as for depression, tobacco use, and being overweight, so it might be a great choice for patients 
with a combination of these problems. Alpha agonists, such as guanfacine and clonidine, are helpful for both 
ADHD and insomnia, another potential two-fer, though these meds tend to be used more frequently for children.
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
4. Fancy formulations.  Many new formulations of amphetamines and methylphenidates have been introduced 
over the last few years, including the use of various drug delivery technologies, enantiomers, prodrugs, salts, 
and dosage forms. While they may have been marketed to increase drug company pro/f_its, some of them may 
have clinical utility. Examples of potentially useful advances include Quillichew ER (a chewable long-acting 
methylphenidate), Cotempla XR-ODT (an ODT long-acting methylphenidate), Adzenys XR-ODT (an ODT long-acting 
amphetamine), Dyanavel XR (a long-acting liquid amphetamine), and most intriguingly, Jornay PM (a long-acting 
methylphenidate you take at night that kicks in the next morning). We cover these formulations in the ADHD 
Medications table.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
5. Cost.  Most ADHD meds are available generically, but some reasonable choices are still branded and therefore 
more expensive. The most popular of these is Vyvanse, which is a long-acting amphetamine. Vyvanse appears to 
have a genuine advantage over many other stimulants, mainly in terms of tolerability and less potential for abuse. 
However, you’ll have a hard time convincing insurance companies to cover the cost of Vyvanse unless you can 
clearly document intolerance in several other trials of stimulants. While the generic just launched, it's still more 
expensive than other stimulant generics.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Dose Equivalents and Switching Strategies
Most patients need to try diﬀerent stimulants, or stimulant formulations, before settling on the one that works best 
for them. The dose equivalents are, luckily, fairly easy to remember.
1. From one amphetamine to another amphetamine
 /uni2981With the exception of Vyvanse, all amphetamines, including both Adderall IR and XR, are roughly equivalent 
in potency. For example, if a patient is taking Dexedrine 10 mg TID, you can switch this to Adderall 15 mg BID 
or Adderall XR 30 mg QD. That said, some people believe that Dexedrine, being 100% dextroamphetamine, 
might be more potent than Adderall, which is 75% d-amphetamine and 25% l-amphetamine (eg, 30 mg/day of 
Dexedrine may be closer to 40 mg/day of Adderall). In reality, the diﬀerence is likely negligible in most people.
 /uni2981Vyvanse is composed of both lysine and amphetamine, with amphetamine making up only about 30% of 
Vyvanse. This means that it’s much less potent than straight Dexedrine. So, when switching from another 
amphetamine to Vyvanse, you have to at least double the dose.
2. From one methylphenidate to another methylphenidate
 /uni2981With the exception of Concerta and Focalin, all methylphenidate preparations are roughly equivalent in potency.
 /uni2981Concerta, because of its complex delivery system, delivers less methylphenidate than implied by the mg amount 
you prescribe. The usual conversion percentage used is 83%, meaning that the body sees 83% of Concerta  in methylphenidate equivalents. Thus, Concerta 18 mg is equivalent to methylphenidate 15 mg, 36 mg is 
equivalent to 30 mg, and so on.
 /uni2981Focalin is the dextro-isomer of methylphenidate, which is twice as potent as methylphenidate. Thus, use about 
half the dose when prescribing Focalin.
3. From a methylphenidate to an amphetamine (or vice versa)
 /uni2981Methylphenidate is roughly half as potent as amphetamine, so Ritalin 10 mg = Dexedrine 5 mg, etc. Consistent 
with this equivalency, child psychiatrists often dose methylphenidate at 1 mg/kg, whereas they dose 
amphetamine at 0.5 mg/kg. Conversely, if you’re switching from Dexedrine to Ritalin, you would need to increase 
the dose by a factor of two.
4. From an oral methylphenidate to the methylphenidate patch (Daytrana)
 /uni2981According to a clinical trial of patients switched from various versions of long-acting methylphenidate to the 
patch, you should dose the patch at about half the dose of the oral medication (Arnold LE et al, Curr Med Res Opin  
2010;26(1):129–137).

------------------------------------------------------------------- 

How to Switch
Once you’ve determined the dose equivalence, the actual switching is easy. You don’t have to cross-taper; instead, 
have your patient take the last dose of stimulant A on day one and start stimulant B on day two. To be prudent, start 
the new stimulant at a somewhat lower dose than you calculate would be needed based on the equivalent dose rules 
of thumb. Those equivalencies are based on averages and may not apply to a given individual.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Side Eﬀects and Class Warnings
The following apply to all stimulants:
 /uni2981Potential to cause psychosis or aggression.  This is a rare and dose-related eﬀect; it may be more likely in patients with 
a predisposition for psychosis.
 /uni2981Worsening or new-onset Tourette’s or tic disorders.  Stimulants may unmask tics. Of stimulants, methylphenidate is 
favored. The non-stimulant guanfacine is an even better alternative.
 /uni2981Seizures.  Stimulants may lower the seizure threshold, although data are contradictory; monitor patients with seizure 
disorders closely.
 /uni2981Growth inhibition or weight loss.  With long-term use, some growth inhibition may occur occasionally in children, 
but this is generally not a major problem. Monitoring growth and considering “drug holidays” may limit growth 
suppression.
 /uni2981Cardiovascular safety.  The FDA issued a serious class warning in 2006 with regard to cardiovascular safety. However, 
newer data, both in children and in adults, have been reassuring. Cardiac events occurred at virtually the same 
or lower rates among people who took stimulants compared to those who did not. From a practical perspective, 
we recommend asking about cardiac problems and consulting the child’s pediatrician or cardiologist if a problem 
exists. Amphetamines should be avoided in patients with known or suspected cardiovascular disease.
 /uni2981Potential for misuse and abuse.  The FDA updated the class warnings for all stimulants in 2023 to include the potential 
for misuse, abuse, addiction, overdose, and death compared to the previous warning of a “potential for abuse and 
dependence. ” Just as before, patients should be assessed and monitored for risk of misuse.
 /uni2981No re/f_ills. All stimulants are controlled substances (Schedule II), which means they can’t be re/f_illed or called in. 
Patients must be given a new prescription every month. In most states, you are allowed to give patients post-dated 
prescriptions for convenience.

19AMPHETAMINE  (Adzenys XR-ODT, Dyanavel XR, Evekeo) Fact Sheet [G]
Bottom Line:
Amphetamine is a 50:50 racemic mixture of dextro- and levo-amphetamine. In clinical practice, the most commonly 
prescribed amphetamine is Adderall (mixed amphetamine salts; see fact sheet later in this chapter). Based on meta-
analyses, amphetamines are clearly the most eﬀective option in both children and adults with ADHD. That doesn’t 
mean they should always be the /f_irst choice, though. Methylphenidates are often better tolerated and have relatively 
less abuse potential. Several newer formulations of amphetamine may be helpful for patients who don’t like to 
swallow pills—but they come with a price tag.
FDA Indications:
ADHD  (Adzenys XR-ODT: adults and children ≥6; Dyanavel XR: children ≥6; Evekeo: children ≥3); narcolepsy (Evekeo); 
obesity (Evekeo).
Oﬀ-Label Uses:
Treatment-resistant depression.
Dosage Forms:
 /uni2981Tablets (Evekeo, [G]):  5 mg, 10 mg (scored); (Evekeo ODT):  5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg.
 /uni2981ER tablets (Dyanavel XR):  5 mg (scored), 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg.
 /uni2981ER orally disintegrating tablets (Adzenys XR-ODT):  3.1 mg, 6.3 mg, 9.4 mg, 12.5 mg, 15.7 mg, 18.8 mg.
 /uni2981ER oral suspension (Dyanavel XR): 2.5 mg/mL.
Dosage Guidance:
 /uni2981Tablets (Evekeo, [G]):
 –Children 3–5: Start 2.5 mg QAM, increase in 2.5 mg/day increments weekly.
 –Children 6–17: Start 5 mg QAM, increase in 5 mg/day increments weekly to maximum of 40 mg/day in divided doses.
 –Narcolepsy: Start 5 mg QAM (ages 6–12) or 10 mg QAM (ages >12), increase by 5 or 10 mg/day increments weekly, 
respectively. Maximum 60 mg/day in divided doses.
 /uni2981ER ODT (Adzenys XR-ODT):
 –Start 6.3 mg QAM, increase in 3.1–6.3 mg/day increments weekly. Maximum of 18.8 mg/day (ages 6–12) or 12.5 
mg/day (ages 13–17 and adults).
 /uni2981ER oral suspension (Dyanavel XR):
 –Children 6–12: Start 2.5–5 mg QAM, increase in 2.5–10 mg/day increments every four to seven days. Maximum 20 mg/day.
Monitoring:  ECG if history of cardiac disease.
Cost:  (G): $$$; others: $$$$
Side Eﬀects:
 /uni2981Most common: Abdominal pain, decreased appetite, weight loss, insomnia, headache, nervousness.
 /uni2981Serious but rare: See class warnings in chapter introduction.
 /uni2981Pregnancy/breastfeeding: Limited data in pregnancy; likely safe in breastfeeding.
Mechanism, Pharmacokinetics, and Drug Interactions:
 /uni2981Stimulant that inhibits reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine.
 /uni2981Metabolized primarily via CYP2D6; t ½: 11 hours.
 /uni2981Avoid use with MAOIs, antacids.
Clinical Pearls:
 /uni2981These racemic forms of amphetamine diﬀer from dextroamphetamine in that the l-isomer component is more 
potent than the d-isomer in peripheral activity (potentially resulting in more cardiovascular eﬀects and tics).
 /uni2981A racemic mixture may be less appetite suppressing compared to dextroamphetamine.
 /uni2981Divide IR (Evekeo) doses by intervals of four to six hours.
 /uni2981Approximate equivalence doses of Adzenys XR-ODT and mixed amphetamine salts XR (Adderall XR) are: 3.1 mg = 5 
mg, 6.3 mg = 10 mg, 9.4 mg = 15 mg, 12.5 mg = 20 mg, 15.7 mg = 25 mg, 18.8 mg = 30 mg.
 /uni2981Dyanavel XR oral suspension: Shake well to get the intended extended-release eﬀect. The approximate equivalence 
of 2.5 mg/mL is 4 mg of mixed amphetamine salts.
Fun Facts:
The term “amphetamine” is the contracted name of the chemical “alpha-methylphenethylamine. ” Its /f_irst 
pharmacologic use was in 1934 when pharmaceutical company Smith, Kline and French sold amphetamine under the 
trade name Benzedrine as a decongestant inhaler.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
ATOMOXETINE  (Strattera) Fact Sheet [G]
Bottom Line:
Atomoxetine is a non-stimulant ADHD treatment that carries no abuse potential, causes less insomnia and anxiety, 
and is unlikely to worsen tics. Unfortunately, it is generally less eﬀective than stimulants and takes longer to work (two 
to four weeks).
FDA Indications:
ADHD  (adults and children ≥6 years).
Oﬀ-Label Uses:
Treatment-resistant depression.
Dosage Forms:
Capsules (G):  10 mg, 18 mg, 25 mg, 40 mg, 60 mg, 80 mg, 100 mg.
Dosage Guidance:
 /uni2981Start 40 mg QAM for three days, ↑ to 80 mg QAM; may ↑ to 100 mg/day after two to four weeks if needed (max 100 
mg/day); may divide doses >40 mg/day (morning and late afternoon/early evening).
 /uni2981Special dosing for children <70 kg: Start 0.5 mg/kg QAM for three days, ↑ to 1.2 mg/kg QAM; may ↑ to max 1.4 mg/
kg/day or 100 mg/day (whichever is less) after two to four weeks if needed; may divide doses >0.5 mg/kg/day.
Monitoring:  Baseline LFTs; follow up if signs of liver disease.
Cost:  $
Side Eﬀects:
 /uni2981Most common: Children:  Headache, abdominal pain, decreased appetite, fatigue, nausea, vomiting. Adults:  Nausea, 
dry mouth, decreased appetite, insomnia, constipation, fatigue, erectile dysfunction, abdominal pain, dizziness, 
urinary hesitation.
 /uni2981Serious but rare: Class warning for suicidal ideation in children and teens. Severe hepatic injury including increased 
hepatic enzymes (up to 40 times normal) and jaundice (bilirubin up to 12 times upper limit of normal). Increased 
blood pressure ( ↑ 15–20 mmHg) and heart rate ( ↑ 20 bpm).
 /uni2981Pregnancy/breastfeeding: Limited but reassuring data in pregnancy; minimal data in breastfeeding.
Mechanism, Pharmacokinetics, and Drug Interactions:
 /uni2981Selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (NRI).
 /uni2981Metabolized primarily via CYP2D6; t ½: 5 hours.
 /uni2981Avoid use with MAOIs. Exercise caution with 2D6 inhibitors such as /f_luoxetine, paroxetine, and quinidine (increased 
atomoxetine serum levels); use slower titration and do not exceed 80 mg/day in presence of 2D6 inhibitors or in 2D6 
poor metabolizers.
Clinical Pearls:
 /uni2981QAM and BID dosing are equally eﬀective, but BID dosing has better GI tolerability. Can also be dosed at bedtime if 
it causes fatigue.
 /uni2981Appears to be more eﬀective in improving attention than in controlling hyperactivity.
Fun Fact:
Atomoxetine was originally known as “tomoxetine”; however, the FDA requested that the name be changed because 
the similarity to “tamoxifen” could lead to dispensing errors.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
21CLONIDINE  (Catapres, Kapvay) Fact Sheet [G]
Bottom Line:
Clonidine is an alpha-2 agonist that has no abuse potential, does not worsen tics, and does not cause insomnia. 
However, it’s less eﬀective than stimulants and has a delayed onset of eﬀect (two to four weeks); it is often added 
to a stimulant to prevent insomnia. Clonidine may be used as a second-line option for opioid detoxi/f_ication if 
buprenorphine or methadone are not available.
FDA Indications:
Hypertension;  ADHD  (children ages 6–17), as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy to stimulants (not approved for 
ADHD in adults).
Oﬀ-Label Uses:
Conduct disorder; Tourette’s and motor tics; pervasive developmental disorders; migraine prophylaxis; opioid 
withdrawal.
Dosage Forms:
 /uni2981IR tablets (Catapres, [G]):  0.1 mg, 0.2 mg, 0.3 mg.
 /uni2981ER tablets (Kapvay, [G]):  0.1 mg, 0.2 mg.
 /uni2981Patch (Catapres-TTS, [G]):  0.1 mg/day, 0.2 mg/day, 0.3 mg/day.
Dosage Guidance:
 /uni2981IR: Start 0.1 mg BID, ↑ by 0.1 mg/day at weekly intervals; max 2 mg/day. For opioid withdrawal, may be dosed 
0.1–0.2 mg every four to six hours as needed. Daily dosing requirement can be established by tabulating the total 
amount administered over the /f_irst 24 hours and dividing this amount into a TID or QID schedule. Total dose should 
not exceed 1.2 mg the /f_irst 24 hours and 2 mg/day beyond that.
 /uni2981ER: Start 0.1 mg QHS, ↑ by 0.1 mg/day at weekly intervals; max 0.4 mg/day. May divide doses >0.2 mg/day; divided 
doses may be unequal with higher dose given at bedtime.
Monitoring:  Blood pressure (hold doses for BP <90/60).
Cost:  $
Side Eﬀects:
 /uni2981Most common: Dry mouth, somnolence, dizziness, constipation, fatigue, headache.
 /uni2981Serious but rare: Hypotension, syncope, orthostasis.
 /uni2981Pregnancy/breastfeeding: Limited data in pregnancy; not recommended in breastfeeding and may lower milk 
supply.
Mechanism, Pharmacokinetics, and Drug Interactions:
 /uni2981Centrally acting, selective alpha-2 adrenergic agonist.
 /uni2981Metabolized primarily through CYP2D6; t ½: 6–20 hours.
 /uni2981Avoid use with MAOIs. Caution with 2D6 inhibitors (eg, paroxetine, /f_luoxetine, duloxetine).
Clinical Pearls:
 /uni2981Not a controlled substance.
 /uni2981Clonidine tends to be more sedating than guanfacine, another alpha agonist.
 /uni2981When used in detox, clonidine relieves most opioid withdrawal symptoms but is less eﬀective than methadone or 
buprenorphine. Therefore, adjunctive medications are often used with clonidine to manage insomnia, muscle pain, 
headache, agitation, and other symptoms. Even so, detox completion rates with clonidine are typically signi/f_icantly 
lower than those with buprenorphine or methadone.
 /uni2981The patch formulation is not typically used (except for hypertension) because clonidine’s eﬀects on BP may be 
prolonged and continue even after patch removal.
 /uni2981If patient misses two or more consecutive doses, consider repeating titration.
 /uni2981Minimize side eﬀects, especially somnolence, by administering at bedtime.
 /uni2981Monitor blood pressure, especially during initial dosing titration.
 /uni2981Risk of nervousness, anxiety, and possibly rebound hypertension two to four days after abrupt discontinuation. 
Taper dose in no more than 0.1 mg/day decrements, every three to seven days.
Fun Fact:
The Federal Bureau of Prisons’ clinical guidance document, Detoxi/f_ication of Chemically Dependent Inmates,  
recommends maintaining strict control over medication access to prevent diversion or misuse. It cites the example of 
inmates eating clonidine patches to obtain a state of euphoria.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
DEXMETHYLPHENIDATE  (Azstarys, Focalin, Focalin XR) Fact Sheet [G]
Bottom Line:
Dexmethylphenidate (Focalin) is the d-isomer of methylphenidate and is two times more potent than 
methylphenidate. Azstarys is a newly approved (and expensive) combination of Focalin and a prodrug version 
of Focalin—the Focalin is absorbed quickly while the prodrug is absorbed more slowly (it’s the Vyvanse of 
methylphenidate). There’s no clear advantage of Focalin over Ritalin—the main diﬀerence is that Focalin may mean 
fewer tablets for patients. Focalin XR only recently went generic, so it will likely remain quite expensive for a while. 
Azstarys may be less abusable than Focalin.
FDA Indications:
ADHD in adults (Azstarys, Focalin XR) and in children ≥6 years (Azstarys, Focalin IR and XR).
Oﬀ-Label Uses:
Narcolepsy, obesity, treatment-resistant depression.
Dosage Forms:
 /uni2981Dexmethylphenidate tablets (Focalin, [G]):  2.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg.
 /uni2981Dexmethylphenidate ER capsules (Focalin XR, [G]):  5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg, 25 mg, 30 mg, 35 mg, 40 mg.
 /uni2981Serdexmethylphenidate/dexmethylphenidate ER capsules (Azstarys):  26.1/5.2 mg, 39.2/7.8 mg, 52.3/10.4 mg.
Dosage Guidance:
 /uni2981d-MPH IR: Start 2.5 mg BID, ↑ by 5–10 mg/day every seven days. Max 20 mg/day; divide IR doses by at least four 
hours.
 /uni2981d-MPH ER: Start 10 mg QAM, ↑ by 10 mg/day every seven days. Max 40 mg/day. For children, start 5 mg QAM, ↑ by 5 
mg/day every seven days. Max (children) 30 mg/day.
 /uni2981Serdex-MPH/d-MPH: Start 39.2/7.8 mg QAM, ↑ to max dose of 52.3/10.4 mg after one week if indicated.
Monitoring:  ECG if history of cardiac disease.
Cost:  IR: $; ER: $$; Azstarys: $$$$
Side Eﬀects:
 /uni2981Most common: Decreased appetite, insomnia, anxiety, GI distress, irritability, tics, headache, tachycardia, 
hypertension, dry mouth.
 /uni2981Serious but rare: See class warnings in chapter introduction.
 /uni2981Pregnancy/breastfeeding: Limited data in pregnancy; likely safe in breastfeeding.
Mechanism, Pharmacokinetics, and Drug Interactions:
 /uni2981Stimulant that inhibits reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine.
 /uni2981Serdexmethylphenidate (Serdex-MPH) is a prodrug of dexmethylphenidate (d-MPH). d-MPH is metabolized primarily 
via de-esteri/f_ication, not CYP450. d-MPH t ½: 2–4.5 hours (2–3 hours in children); d-MPH ER delivers 50% of dose 
immediately and 50% about /f_ive hours later. Azstarys t ½: 6–12 hours; delivers 30% d-MPH immediately and 70% as 
prodrug.
 /uni2981Avoid use with MAOIs.
Clinical Pearls:
 /uni2981d-MPH is the d-isomer of methylphenidate and is two times more potent than methylphenidate, which is why it is 
prescribed at about half the dose. Serdex-MPH is a prodrug, converted to d-MPH in the lower GI tract.
 /uni2981Use the same total daily dose of Focalin IR as Focalin XR. The combined dose of Azstarys 26.1/5.2, 39.2/7.8, or 
52.3/10.4 mg is equivalent to 20, 30, or 40 mg of Focalin, respectively.
 /uni2981Focalin XR capsules contain two kinds of beads: Half are IR beads and half are enteric-coated DR beads. A single, 
once-daily XR capsule provides the same amount of dexmethylphenidate as two IR tablets given four hours apart.
 /uni2981The ER capsules cannot be split in half. However, they can be opened and the beads sprinkled over food. The patient 
should then eat all that food—eating half won’t work to split the dose accurately because it won’t be possible to 
determine if the eaten portion contains more immediate-release or delayed-release beads.
 /uni2981Give with food if GI side eﬀects occur.
Fun Fact:
With two stereoactive centers, methylphenidate has four possible stereoisomers. Of the four, dexmethylphenidate is 
the most active biologically.

23DEXTROAMPHETAMINE  (Dexedrine, Dextrostat, 
Liquadd, ProCentra, Zenzedi) Fact Sheet [G]
Bottom Line:
Dextroamphetamine is the dextro-isomer of racemic amphetamine. It has a long history of safe use in children, and is 
available in short- and long-acting formulations as generics.
FDA Indications:
ADHD (children ≥3 years);  narcolepsy (adults and children ≥6 years).
Oﬀ-Label Uses:
Obesity, treatment-resistant depression.
Dosage Forms:
 /uni2981Tablets (Dexedrine, Dextrostat, [G]):  5 mg, 10 mg (scored).
 /uni2981Tablets (Zenzedi):  2.5 mg, 5 mg, 7.5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg, 30 mg (5 mg scored, 10 mg double scored; rest 
unscored).
 /uni2981ER capsules (Dexedrine Spansules, [G]):  5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg.
 /uni2981Liquid (Liquadd, ProCentra, [G]):  5 mg/5 mL.
Dosage Guidance:
 /uni2981ADHD (IR and ER):
 –Adults and children ≥6 years: Start 5 mg QAM, ↑ by 5 mg/day at weekly intervals to max 60 mg/day, though doses 
≥40 mg/day are rarely more eﬀective. Divide IR dose QD–TID.
 –Children 3−5 years: Start 2.5 mg QAM, ↑ by 2.5 mg/day weekly to max 60 mg/day, though doses >40 mg/day are 
rarely more eﬀective. Divide IR dose QD–TID.
 /uni2981Narcolepsy (IR and ER):
 –Start 10 mg QAM, ↑ by 10 mg/day weekly to max 60 mg/day. Divide IR dose QD–TID.
Monitoring:  ECG if history of cardiac disease.
Cost:  IR/ER: $ (Zenzedi: $$; ProCentra: $$$$)
Side Eﬀects:
 /uni2981Most common: Abdominal pain, anorexia, nausea, tics, insomnia, tachycardia, headache.
 /uni2981Serious but rare: See class warnings in chapter introduction.
 /uni2981Pregnancy/breastfeeding: Limited data in pregnancy; likely safe in breastfeeding.
Mechanism, Pharmacokinetics, and Drug Interactions:
 /uni2981Stimulant that inhibits reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine.
 /uni2981Metabolized primarily through CYP2D6 (minor) and glucuronidation; t ½: 12 hours.
 /uni2981Avoid use with MAOIs, antacids.
Clinical Pearls:
 /uni2981Dextroamphetamine is the more potent d-isomer of amphetamine; it has potentially less peripheral eﬀects (eg, 
motor tics) than a racemic mix (eg, mixed amphetamine salts like Adderall, amphetamine, or methamphetamine).
 /uni2981IR tablets and oral solution: Doses can be given at intervals of four to six hours.
 /uni2981Dextroamphetamine is the only stimulant, other than Adderall IR, approved for children <6 years (approved for 
children ≥3 years).
 /uni2981The newer Zenzedi brand oﬀers more dosing /f_lexibility options, but it is more expensive than generic IR tablets.
 /uni2981Also available as D,L racemic mixture of amphetamine as Evekeo tablets, Adzenys XR-ODT, and Dyanavel XR oral 
suspension (see amphetamine fact sheet).
Fun Fact:
Dexys Midnight Runners, the British band famous for its song “Come On Eileen” (1982), derived their name from 
Dexedrine—“Dexys” after the drug’s name and “Midnight Runners” in reference to the energy it provides.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
DEXTROAMPHETAMINE  TRANSDERMAL  (Xelstrym) Fact Sheet
Bottom Line:
Like Daytrana, Xelstrym is helpful for those who, for whatever reason, cannot use any of the wide variety of oral 
stimulant preparations. Otherwise, we don’t recommend it due to high cost, lag time for onset of eﬀect, and the side 
eﬀect of rash, which is pretty common and unpleasant.
FDA Indications:
ADHD  (adult and children ≥6 years).
Dosage Forms:
Transdermal patch:  4.5 mg, 9 mg, 13.5 mg, 18 mg/9 hour.
Dosage Guidance:
 /uni2981Adults: Start 9 mg/9 hour patch QAM (for initial therapy or for patients switching from other amphetamine 
preparations, regardless of dose). Titrate in increments of 4.5 mg weekly up to a maximum 18 mg QAM.
 /uni2981Children: Start 4.5 mg/9 hour patch QAM; titrate in weekly increments of 4.5 mg up to max 18 mg QAM.
Monitoring:  ECG if history of cardiac disease.
Cost:  $$$$
Side Eﬀects:
 /uni2981Most common: Decreased appetite, headache, insomnia, tic, abdominal pain, vomiting, nausea, irritability, increased 
BP and pulse. Application site reactions and sensitization may occur.
 /uni2981Serious but rare: See class warnings in chapter introduction.
 /uni2981Pregnancy/breastfeeding: Limited data in pregnancy; likely safe in breastfeeding.
Mechanism, Pharmacokinetics, and Drug Interactions:
 /uni2981Stimulant that inhibits reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine.
 /uni2981Metabolized primarily through CYP2D6 (minor) and glucuronidation; t ½: 11.5 hours (6.4 hours in children).
 /uni2981Avoid use with MAOIs, antacids.
Clinical Pearls:
 /uni2981Apply to hip, upper arm, chest, upper back, or /f_lank two hours before an eﬀect is needed and remove nine hours 
after application (drug eﬀects may persist for /f_ive hours after removal). Increase dose at weekly intervals by using 
next higher dose system. May be removed sooner if shorter duration is desired or if late-day side eﬀects occur. 
Rotate application sites.
 /uni2981Clinical eﬀect usually seen in two hours and lasts approximately 12 hours.
 /uni2981Exposure of application site to a heat source (eg, hair dryer, heating pad, electric blanket) may increase the rate and 
amount of drug absorbed.
 /uni2981For localized skin reactions (redness at site), use cortisone cream (1%–2%). For more severe or systemic reactions, 
discontinue patch.
Fun Fact:
While Daytrana is approved for pediatric use only, Xelstrym is also approved for use in adults.

25GUANFACINE  (Intuniv, Tenex) Fact Sheet [G]
Bottom Line:
Guanfacine is an alpha-2 agonist that has no abuse potential, does not worsen tics, and does not cause insomnia. 
However, it is less eﬀective than stimulants and has a delayed onset of eﬀect (two to four weeks). Guanfacine ER is 
now available in generic and is easier to use than IR.
FDA Indications:
ADHD  (children ages 6–17), as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy to stimulants (not approved for ADHD in adults).
Oﬀ-Label Uses:
Conduct disorder; Tourette’s and motor tics; pervasive developmental disorders; migraine prophylaxis; opioid 
withdrawal.
Dosage Forms:
 /uni2981IR tablets (Tenex, [G]):  1 mg, 2 mg.
 /uni2981ER tablets (Intuniv, [G]):  1 mg, 2 mg, 3 mg, 4 mg.
Dosage Guidance:
 /uni2981IR dosing depends on weight:
 –27–40.5 kg (55–90 lbs): Start 0.5 mg QHS, ↑ by 0.5 mg/day at weekly intervals up to 1.5 mg/day; may ↑ to 2 mg/
day after two weeks; max 2 mg/day in two to four divided doses.
 –40.5–45 kg (90–99 lbs): Start 0.5 mg QHS, ↑ by 0.5 mg/day at weekly intervals; max 1 mg per dose, 3 mg/day.
 –>45 kg ( >99 lbs): Start 1 mg QHS, ↑ by 1 mg/day at weekly intervals up to 3 mg/day; may ↑ to 4 mg/day after 2 
weeks; max 1 mg per dose, 4 mg/day.
 /uni2981ER: Start 1 mg QHS, ↑ by 1 mg/day at weekly intervals; max 4 mg/day. Alternative: 0.05–0.12 mg/kg QD or QHS; max 
4 mg/day. Doses up to 7 mg/day ER studied as monotherapy in adolescents.
Monitoring:  Blood pressure.
Cost:  $
Side Eﬀects:
 /uni2981Most common: Dry mouth, somnolence, dizziness, constipation, fatigue, headache.
 /uni2981Serious but rare: Hypotension, syncope, orthostasis.
 /uni2981Pregnancy/breastfeeding: Not well studied.
Mechanism, Pharmacokinetics, and Drug Interactions:
 /uni2981Centrally acting, selective alpha-2 adrenergic agonist.
 /uni2981Metabolized primarily through CYP3A4; t ½: 13–14 hours in children (16–18 hours in adults).
 /uni2981Avoid use with MAOIs. Caution with 3A4 inhibitors (eg, clarithromycin, /f_luvoxamine) and inducers (eg, St. John’s 
wort, carbamazepine).
Clinical Pearls:
 /uni2981Not a controlled substance.
 /uni2981Guanfacine IR and ER are not interchangeable on a mg:mg basis. When switching from one formulation to the other, 
taper and re-titrate.
 /uni2981Guanfacine tends to be less sedating than clonidine, another alpha agonist.
 /uni2981If patient misses two or more consecutive doses, consider repeating titration.
 /uni2981ER tablets should not be taken with a high-fat meal due to increased medication exposure.
 /uni2981Minimize side eﬀects, especially somnolence, by administering at bedtime.
 /uni2981Monitor blood pressure, especially during initial dosing titration.
 /uni2981Risk of nervousness, anxiety, and possibly rebound hypertension two to four days after abrupt discontinuation. 
Taper dose in 1 mg/day decrements, every three to seven days.
Fun Fact:
Some prescribers have taken advantage of guanfacine’s sympatholytic properties for the treatment of nightmares and 
dissociative symptoms in PTSD.
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
LISDEXAMFETAMINE  (Vyvanse) Fact Sheet [G]
Bottom Line:
Vyvanse may have a gentler, “smoother” side eﬀect pro/f_ile than other amphetamines, and it probably has a lower risk 
of diversion or abuse. However, its high cost even in generic form means insurance companies don’t like to pay for it 
without prior authorization.
FDA Indications:
ADHD  (adults and children ≥6 years); binge eating disorder  (BED).
Oﬀ-Label Uses:
Narcolepsy; obesity; treatment-resistant depression.
Dosage Forms:
 /uni2981Capsules:  10 mg, 20 mg, 30 mg, 40 mg, 50 mg, 60 mg, 70 mg.
 /uni2981Chewtabs:  10 mg, 20 mg, 30 mg, 40 mg, 50 mg, 60 mg.
Dosage Guidance:
 /uni2981ADHD (adults and children ≥6 years): Start 30 mg QAM, ↑ by 10–20 mg/day at weekly intervals. Target lowest 
eﬀective dose; max 70 mg/day.
 /uni2981BED: Start 30 mg QAM, ↑ by 20 mg/day at weekly intervals to target 50 mg/day; max 70 mg/day.
Monitoring:  ECG if history of cardiac disease.
Cost:  $$$
Side Eﬀects:
 /uni2981Most common: Headache, insomnia, anorexia, abdominal pain, irritability, agitation, tics, decreased appetite, 
increased heart rate, jitteriness, anxiety.
 /uni2981Serious but rare: See class warnings in chapter introduction.
 /uni2981Pregnancy/breastfeeding: Limited data in pregnancy; likely safe in breastfeeding.
Mechanism, Pharmacokinetics, and Drug Interactions:
 /uni2981Stimulant that inhibits reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine.
 /uni2981Metabolized primarily through non-CYP-mediated hepatic and/or intestinal metabolism; t ½: lisdexamfetamine 
(inactive prodrug) <1 hour; dextroamphetamine (active metabolite) 12 hours. Dextroamphetamine metabolized by 
CYP2D6.
 /uni2981Avoid use with MAOIs and antacids. Caution with antihypertensives (decreased eﬃcacy of antihypertensive). 
Caution with 2D6 inhibitors, which may increase stimulant eﬀects.
Clinical Pearls:
 /uni2981Lisdexamfetamine is dextroamphetamine with the chemical lysine bound to it, which renders it inactive. It remains 
inactive until GI enzymes cleave oﬀ lysine and convert it to active dextroamphetamine. This means that drug 
abusers can’t get high by snorting or injecting it.
 /uni2981Anecdotally, Vyvanse has a more gradual onset and oﬀset than other stimulants, and it may cause fewer side eﬀects 
than other amphetamines.
 /uni2981Taking with food decreases the eﬀect slightly and delays peak levels by an hour. If patients feel it’s not “kicking in” 
fast enough, have them take it earlier or on an empty stomach.
 /uni2981Lisdexamfetamine 70 mg is equivalent to 30 mg of mixed amphetamine salts (Adderall).
 /uni2981While indicated for BED, it is not approved for use as a weight loss or anti-obesity agent.
Fun Fact:
The manufacturer of Vyvanse pursued an indication as an add-on medication for depression, but disappointing results 
in clinical trials put an end to this eﬀort.
ADHD Medications
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
27METHAMPHETAMINE  (Desoxyn) Fact Sheet [G]
Bottom Line:
Methamphetamine is highly addictive when used in its crystal form (“crystal meth”), because it causes an immediate 
and intense high when snorted or smoked. Its use is generally not recommended. Watch the television show 
“Breaking Bad” if you’re not convinced!
FDA Indications:
ADHD  (children ≥6 years); obesity (adults and adolescents ≥12 years).
Dosage Forms:
Tablets (G):  5 mg.
Dosage Guidance:
ADHD (adults and children ≥6 years): Start 5 mg QAM–BID, ↑ by 5 mg/day at weekly intervals to max 20 mg/day, 
divided BID.
Monitoring:  ECG if history of cardiac disease.
Cost:  $$$$
Side Eﬀects:
 /uni2981Most common: Anorexia, tachycardia, dizziness, insomnia, tremor, tics, restlessness, headache, constipation 
(decreased GI motility). Dental complications, such as poor dental hygiene, diﬀuse cavities, bruxism, and tooth wear, 
may develop with abuse.
 /uni2981Serious but rare: See class warnings in chapter introduction.
 /uni2981Pregnancy/breastfeeding: Limited data in pregnancy; likely safe in breastfeeding.
Mechanism, Pharmacokinetics, and Drug Interactions:
 /uni2981Stimulant that inhibits reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine.
 /uni2981Metabolized primarily through CYP2D6 to active metabolite (amphetamine); t ½: 4–5 hours.
 /uni2981Avoid use with MAOIs and antacids. Caution with 2D6 inhibitors, which may increase stimulant eﬀects.
Clinical Pearls:
 /uni2981High risk of abuse.
 /uni2981Not widely used (DEA reports that there were only 8,000 prescriptions written in 2021). When prescribed for obesity, 
the recommendation is for short-term use only (ie, a few weeks) and as an adjunct to caloric restriction due to its 
high addiction and diversion potential.
 /uni2981Methamphetamine’s CNS-stimulating eﬀect is approximately equal to or greater than that of amphetamine but less 
than that of dextroamphetamine; less blood pressure elevation than with amphetamine.
Fun Facts:
Methamphetamine was originally used in nasal decongestants and bronchial inhalers (the levo-isomer is still utilized 
for these indications, sold over the counter as Vicks VapoInhaler, Equaline, and generics).
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
METHYLPHENIDATE  IR (Methylin, Ritalin) Fact Sheet [G]
Bottom Line:
Methylphenidate has a better side eﬀect pro/f_ile and somewhat lower abuse potential than amphetamines. However, 
patients often prefer the “kick” they get from Adderall.
FDA Indications:
ADHD  (adults and children ≥6 years); narcolepsy .
Oﬀ-Label Uses:
Obesity; treatment-resistant depression.
Dosage Forms:
 /uni2981Tablets (Ritalin, [G]):  5 mg, 10 mg, 20 mg.
 /uni2981Chewable tablets (Methylin CT, [G]):  2.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg.
 /uni2981Oral solution (Methylin, [G]):  5 mg/5 mL, 10 mg/5 mL.
Dosage Guidance:
 /uni2981ADHD:
 –Adults: Start 5–10 mg BID, ↑ by 10 mg/day at weekly intervals to max 60 mg/day.
 –Children ≥6 years: Start 0.3 mg/kg BID or 2.5–5 mg BID before breakfast and lunch, increase by 0.1 mg/kg/dose or 
5–10 mg/day at weekly intervals to a max of 2 mg/kg/day or 60 mg/day.
 /uni2981Narcolepsy: Same dosing as ADHD.
Monitoring:  ECG if history of cardiac disease.
Cost:  $; chewable tabs: $$$
Side Eﬀects:
 /uni2981Most common: Insomnia, headache, nervousness, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, weight loss, aﬀect 
lability, tics.
 /uni2981Serious but rare: See class warnings in chapter introduction.
 /uni2981Pregnancy/breastfeeding: Limited data in pregnancy; likely safe in breastfeeding.
Mechanism, Pharmacokinetics, and Drug Interactions:
 /uni2981Stimulant that inhibits reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine.
 /uni2981Hepatic metabolism via carboxylesterase CES1A1, not CYP450 isoenzymes; t ½: 2–4 hours.
 /uni2981Avoid use with MAOIs, antacids.
Clinical Pearls:
 /uni2981Methylphenidate generally causes fewer side eﬀects than amphetamine preparations—patients are less likely to 
report feeling “wired.”
 /uni2981While all stimulants may cause tics, a Cochrane review of eight randomized trials showed that methylphenidate did 
not worsen tics in children with ADHD and a tic disorder; in some cases it even improved tics.
 /uni2981Methylin chewable tablets: Administer with at least eight ounces of water or other /f_luid.
Fun Fact:
Methylphenidate was synthesized by Ciba (now Novartis) chemist Leandro Panizzon. His wife, Marguerite, had low 
blood pressure and would take the stimulant before playing tennis. He named the substance “Ritaline” (yes, with the 
“e” on the end) after his wife’s nickname, Rita.

between 6:30 and 9:30 p.m.
 /uni2981Narcolepsy: Start 10–20 mg ER QAM, ↑ by 10 mg/day at weekly intervals; max 60 mg/day.
Monitoring:  ECG if history of cardiac disease.
Cost:  $; Concerta: $$$; Aptensio XR, Cotempla XR-ODT, Jornay PM, Quillivant XR, Quillichew ER, Relexxii: $$$$
Side Eﬀects and Mechanism, Pharmacokinetics, and Drug Interactions:
See methylphenidate IR fact sheet.
Clinical Pearls:
 /uni2981ER capsules contain a mixture of 30% IR and 70% ER beads. Aptensio XR  contains a mixture of 40% IR and 60% ER 
beads, whereas Adhansia XR  contains 20% IR and 80% ER. Ritalin LA  and its generic ER capsules are a combination 
of 50% IR and 50% DR beads. These products mimic BID dosing of IR. Cotempla XR-ODT delivers a mixture of 25% 
IR and 75% ER in an orally disintegrating extended-release formulation. Jornay PM  is dosed in the evening; if early-
morning awakening occurs, dose earlier in evening.
 /uni2981Concerta is based on the OROS osmotic delivery system (also used for Invega). 22% of the dose is immediate (with 
eﬀects in one to two hours) and 78% is delayed.
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
METHYLPHENIDATE TRANSDERMAL  (Daytrana) Fact Sheet [G]
Bottom Line:
Daytrana is helpful for kids who, for whatever reason, cannot use any of the wide variety of oral stimulant 
preparations. Otherwise, we don’t recommend it due to high cost, lag time for onset of eﬀect, and the side eﬀect of 
rash, which is pretty common and unpleasant.
FDA Indications:
ADHD  (children ≥6 years).
Dosage Forms:
Transdermal patch (G):  10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg, 30 mg/9 hour.
Dosage Guidance:
Start 10 mg/9 hour patch QAM (for initial therapy or for patients switching from other methylphenidate preparations, 
regardless of dose). Apply to hip two hours before an eﬀect is needed and remove nine hours after application (drug 
eﬀects may persist for /f_ive hours after removal). Increase dose at weekly intervals by using next higher dose system. 
May be removed sooner if shorter duration is desired or if late-day side eﬀects occur. Rotate application sites. Max 
30/uni00A0mg QD.
Monitoring:  ECG if history of cardiac disease.
Cost:  $$$; Daytrana: $$$$
Side Eﬀects:
 /uni2981Most common: Headache, insomnia, irritability, decreased appetite, anorexia, nausea, tics, application site reaction 
(10%–40% incidence in children).
 /uni2981Serious but rare: Allergic contact dermatitis/sensitization, characterized by intense local reactions (eg, edema, 
papules) that may spread beyond patch site; sensitization may subsequently manifest systemically with other routes 
of methylphenidate administration.
 /uni2981Pregnancy/breastfeeding: Limited data in pregnancy; likely safe in breastfeeding.
Mechanism, Pharmacokinetics, and Drug Interactions:
 /uni2981Stimulant that inhibits reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine.
 /uni2981Hepatic metabolism via carboxylesterase CES1A1, not CYP450 isoenzymes; t ½: 3–4 hours.
 /uni2981Avoid use with MAOIs, antacids.
Clinical Pearls:
 /uni2981Apply patch to clean, dry area of the hip; don’t apply to waistline or to areas under tight clothes, as it may rub 
oﬀ. Alternate sites daily (eg, opposite hip). Absorption not aﬀected by perspiration. Remove after nine hours. If 
dislodged, replace with a new patch but remove within the nine-hour total wear time.
 /uni2981Clinical eﬀect usually seen in two hours and lasts approximately 12 hours.
 /uni2981Exposure of application site to a heat source (eg, hair dryer, heating pad, electric blanket) may increase the amount 
of drug absorbed.
 /uni2981For localized skin reactions (redness at site), use cortisone cream (1%–2%). For more severe or systemic reactions, 
discontinue patch.
 /uni2981In June 2015, the FDA added a warning that Daytrana could cause chemical leukoderma, a permanent loss of skin 
color. These reactions are irreversible and not harmful but can be dis/f_iguring. Instruct patients to contact their 
physician if they notice skin color changes or lightening of skin areas; in such cases an alternative medication should 
be considered.
Fun Fact:
Since 2006, Shire Pharmaceuticals has issued at least 10 recalls of Daytrana patches because users have had diﬃculty 
removing the protective cover from the patch. Recall costs have reached into the millions.
ADHD Medications
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
31MIXED AMPHETAMINE SALTS  (Adderall, 
Adderall XR, Mydayis) Fact Sheet [G]
Bottom Line:
Adderall contains 75% dextroamphetamine and 25% levoamphetamine. This ratio of amphetamine isomers is 
eﬀective but is probably the most abused and diverted of all prescription stimulants.
FDA Indications:
ADHD  (adults and children ≥3 years for IR, ≥6 years for XR, ≥13 years for Mydayis); narcolepsy  (adults and children ≥6 
years).
Oﬀ-Label Uses:
Obesity; treatment-resistant depression.
Dosage Forms:
 /uni2981Tablets (G):  5 mg, 7.5 mg, 10 mg, 12.5 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg, 30 mg.
 /uni2981ER capsules (G):  5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg, 25 mg, 30 mg.
 /uni2981ER capsules (Mydayis):  12.5 mg, 25 mg, 37.5 mg, 50 mg.
Dosage Guidance:
 /uni2981ADHD:
 –Rule of thumb for both preparations: Initial dose should be 0.5 mg/kg, but shoot for a target dose 
of 1.0–1.2 mg/kg.
 –Adults:
 /uni25FDIR: Start 5 QAM–BID, max 40 mg/day divided BID.
 /uni25FDER: Start 20 mg QAM, increase to max 60 mg/day QAM. For Mydayis, start 12.5 mg QAM, increase in increments 
of 12.5 mg/day weekly, to max 50 mg/day.
 –Children and adolescents:
 /uni25FDIR: Start 2.5–5 mg BID, max 40 mg/day divided BID.
 /uni25FDER: Start 5–10 mg QAM, increase gradually to max 30 mg/day, or 40 mg/day QAM in adolescents. For Mydayis 
(adolescents ≥13 years), start 12.5 mg QAM, increase in increments of 12.5 mg/day weekly, to max 25 mg/day.
 /uni2981Narcolepsy: Start 10 mg QAM, increase by 10 mg/day at weekly increments; max 60 mg/day.
Monitoring:  ECG if history of cardiac disease.
Cost:  IR/ER: $; Mydayis: $$$$
Side Eﬀects:
 /uni2981Most common: Insomnia, headache, decreased appetite, abdominal pain, weight loss, agitation.
 /uni2981Serious but rare: See class warnings in chapter introduction.
 /uni2981Pregnancy/breastfeeding: Limited data in pregnancy; likely safe in breastfeeding.
Mechanism, Pharmacokinetics, and Drug Interactions:
 /uni2981Stimulant that inhibits reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine.
 /uni2981Metabolized primarily through CYP2D6; t ½: 9–14 hours. Duration of action: 6–8 hours (IR), 8–12 hours (XR).
 /uni2981Avoid use with MAOIs, antacids. Caution with 2D6 inhibitors, which may increase stimulant eﬀects.
Clinical Pearls:
 /uni2981Each dose contains a mixture of amphetamine salts, resulting in a 75:25 ratio of dextro- and levo-isomers of 
amphetamine.
 /uni2981When converting from IR to ER, use the same total daily dose, given QAM.
 /uni2981Adderall may provide more of a “kick” than methylphenidate preparations. Roughly twice as potent (per mg) as 
methylphenidate.
 /uni2981Mydayis is formulated with pH-dependent drug-releasing beads, with IR and DR beads that release drug at pH 5.5 
and 7.0. Duration of eﬀect may be up to 16 hours.
 /uni2981Dextroamphetamine and mixed amphetamine salts are the only stimulants approved for children <6 years 
(approved for children ≥3 years), with the exception of Mydayis, which causes very high rates of side eﬀects 
(insomnia, reduced appetite) in children <13 years and should only be used in children ≥13 years.
Fun Fact:
Was brie/f_ly pulled from the market in Canada in 2005 because of cardiac concerns.
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
VILOXAZINE  XR (Qelbree) Fact Sheet
Bottom Line:
Like the /f_irst norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor for ADHD, atomoxetine, viloxazine has no abuse potential and is less 
likely than stimulants to cause insomnia, anxiety, or tics. However, it is generally less eﬀective than stimulants and 
takes longer to work. It’s unclear if it has any advantage, and unlike atomoxetine, there’s no option for a cheaper 
generic.
FDA Indications:
ADHD  (adults, children ≥6 years).
Oﬀ-Label Uses:
Treatment-resistant depression.
Dosage Forms:
ER capsules:  100 mg, 150 mg, 200 mg.
Dosage Guidance:
 /uni2981Children 6–11: Start 100 mg QD, ↑ by 100 mg/day at weekly intervals to max 400 mg QD.
 /uni2981Children 12–17: Start 200 mg QD, ↑ by 200 mg after one week to max 400 mg QD.
 /uni2981Adults: Start 200 mg QD, ↑ by 200 mg/day at weekly intervals to max 600 mg QD.
Monitoring:  Baseline renal function.
Cost:  $$$$
Side Eﬀects:
 /uni2981Most common: Somnolence, decreased appetite, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, insomnia, irritability.
 /uni2981Serious but rare: Class warning for suicidal ideation in children and teens. Mania reported. May increase pulse and 
BP .
 /uni2981Pregnancy/breastfeeding: Not recommended due to lack of human data and concerning animal data..
Mechanism, Pharmacokinetics, and Drug Interactions:
 /uni2981Selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (NRI).
 /uni2981Metabolized primarily via CYP2D6, UGT1A9, UGTB15; t ½: 7 hours.
 /uni2981Avoid use with MAOIs. Strong 1A2 inhibitor; exercise caution with 1A2 substrates with narrow therapeutic index (eg, 
clozapine, duloxetine, ramelteon, tasimelteon, theophylline, tizanidine) as combination may increase side eﬀects of 
substrate.
Clinical Pearls:
 /uni2981ER capsules, so do not cut, crush, or chew; can open and sprinkle contents in applesauce or pudding.
 /uni2981Adjust dose in severe renal impairment (eGFR <30 mL/min); max 200 mg/day.
 /uni2981Data from one of four studies suggest viloxazine may work a bit faster than atomoxetine (week one vs week three), 
but this /f_inding is not based on head-to-head data and it’s hard to know whether it is clinically signi/f_icant.
Fun Fact:
Viloxazine has been studied for various indications since the 1970s and originally received an FDA orphan drug 
designation for narcolepsy.
------------------------------------------------------------------- 

ADHD Medications(CHILD MEDICATION)

Generally, in treating kids with ADHD, you should start with psychostimulants, since they are the most e ﬀective options. 
Second-line agents include alpha-agonists, followed by atomoxetine, viloxazine, and bupropion.
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
STIMULANT RECOMMENDATIONS (CHILD MEDICATION)
When choosing a stimulant, the /f_irst decision is between an amphetamine or methylphenidate preparation. More recent 
data have suggested that, based on safety and e ﬃcacy, methylphenidates are a better choice in kids and adolescents 
whereas amphetamine-class agents are better in adults. Yet, even in adults, we generally recommend going with a 
methylphenidate preparation /f_irst based on lower side e ﬀect and misuse potential. The second decision is choosing 
between a long-acting or short-acting stimulant.
For kids who don’t like swallowing pills, there are various options. Some long-acting stimulants can be opened and 
sprinkled on food. There are also short- and long-acting liquid, chewable, and disintegrating brand-name options—though 
they are expensive and often require pre-authorization. Finally, another option for the pill-phobics is the Daytrana or 
Xelstrym patch.
When initiating a trial of stimulant medication, titrating the dose on a weekly basis optimizes the response e ﬃciently, 
with the added bene /f_it of limiting the use of additional medications with their associated side e ﬀects. While valproate and 
risperidone have been demonstrated to be e ﬀective for aggression with ADHD, you will rarely need them if you prioritize 
stimulant titration.
The Case for Long-Acting Stimulants
 /uni2981More practical: It’s easier to take a single dose that lasts through the duration of a school day.
 /uni2981Addresses acute tachyphylaxis: Response to stimulants diminishes rapidly, but most newer long-acting stimulants release 
an increasing amount of drug over the /uni00A0dose’s six- to 12-hour course, which most people need for the medication to be 
eﬀective. This avoids the need for multiple short-acting dosage bursts to maintain continued response.
 /uni2981Decreased stimulant rebound: People sensitive to rebound irritability or worsening of ADHD symptoms often report a 
more attenuated rebound with long-acting stimulants.
The Case for Short-Acting Stimulants
 /uni2981For situations where a child only requires a few hours of e ﬀect, such as a half day of school, an afternoon of completing 
homework, or a weekend activity.
 /uni2981Minimizes appetite suppression during meals.
 /uni2981May be less likely to interfere with sleep.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
DOSE EQUIVALENTS (CHILD MEDICATION)
Some kids may need to try di ﬀerent stimulants, or stimulant formulations, before settling on the one that works best for 
them. The dose equivalents are, luckily, fairly easy to remember.
1. From one amphetamine to another amphetamine
 /uni2981With the exception of Vyvanse, all amphetamines, including Adderall IR and XR, are roughly equivalent in potency. For 
example, if a child is taking Dexedrine /uni00A010/uni00A0mg TID, you can switch this to Adderall /uni00A015 mg BID or Adderall XR /uni00A030/uni00A0mg QD. 
That said, some people believe that Dexedrine, being /uni00A0100% dextroamphetamine, might be more potent than Adderall, 
which is /uni00A075% d-amphetamine and /uni00A025% l-amphetamine (eg, Dexedrine /uni00A030/uni00A0mg/day may be closer to /uni00A040/uni00A0mg/day of 
Adderall). In reality, the e ﬀect is likely negligible in most people.
 /uni2981Vyvanse is composed of both lysine and amphetamine, with amphetamine making up only about /uni00A030% of the drug. This 
means that Vyvanse is much less potent than straight Dexedrine. So when switching from another amphetamine to 
Vyvanse, you have to at least double the dose,  and sometimes more.
2. From one methylphenidate to another methylphenidate
 /uni2981With the exception of Concerta and Focalin, all methylphenidate preparations are roughly equivalent in potency.
 /uni2981Concerta, because of its complex delivery system, delivers less methylphenidate than implied by the mg amount 
you prescribe. The usual conversion percentage used is /uni00A083%, meaning that the body sees /uni00A083% of Concerta in 
methylphenidate equivalents. Thus, Concerta /uni00A018/uni00A0mg is equivalent to methylphenidate /uni00A015/uni00A0mg, 36 /uni00A0mg is equivalent 
to/uni00A030/uni00A0mg, and so on.
 /uni2981Focalin is the dextro-isomer of methylphenidate, which is twice as potent as methylphenidate. Thus, use about half the 
dose when using Focalin.
3. From a methylphenidate to an amphetamine (or vice versa)
 /uni2981Methylphenidate is roughly half as potent as amphetamine, so Ritalin /uni00A010/uni00A0mg = Dexedrine /uni00A05/uni00A0mg, etc. Consistent with 
this equivalency, child psychiatrists often dose methylphenidate at /uni00A01/uni00A0mg/kg/immediate-release dose, whereas they 
dose amphetamine at /uni00A00.5/uni00A0mg/kg. Conversely, if you’re switching from Dexedrine to Ritalin, you would need to double 
the dosage.
4. From an oral methylphenidate to the methylphenidate patch (Daytrana)
 /uni2981According to a clinical trial of kids switched from various versions of long-acting methylphenidate to the patch, you 
should dose the patch at about half the dose of the oral medication.
5. From an oral amphetamine to the dextroamphetamine patch (Xelstrym)
 /uni2981As Xelstrym is a newer formulation, the recommendation is to titrate the patch dose from the usual starting dose 
rather than approximate an equivalent substitution dose.
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
HOW TO SWITCH (CHILD MEDICATION)
Once you’ve determined the dose equivalence, the actual switching is easy. Don’t cross-taper; just have your patient take 
the last dose of stimulant A on day /uni00A01/uni00A0and start stimulant B on day /uni00A02. To be prudent, start the new stimulant at a somewhat 
lower dose than the calculation you arrived at via the equivalent dose guideline. Those equivalencies are based on averages 
and may not apply to a given individual.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
HOW TO STOP (CHILD MEDICATION)
When discontinuing stimulant medications, no taper is required; the medications can just be stopped given their fast action 
and metabolism. The same is not true for the longer-acting non-stimulant options—especially alpha-agonists, which should 
be tapered to avoid rebound hypertension. The bigger question is when  to stop. About a third of young patients seem to 
do OK letting go of stimulants in their late teens or early 20s. Others stop due to side e ﬀects, perhaps trying non-stimulant 
options.
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
NON -STIMULANT RECOMMENDATIONS (CHILD MEDICATION)
Although their e ﬃcacy cannot compare to stimulants, atomoxetine or viloxazine may be an appropriate /f_irst step when 
you’re concerned about diversion or substance misuse. For children with severe tic disorders, guanfacine and clonidine may 
be indicated with the added bene /f_it of targeting the tics. Alpha-agonists are also helpful for addressing the frequent sleep 
diﬃculties found in children with ADHD. Patients with comorbid depression or tobacco use may bene /f_it from bupropion. 
A handful of clinical trials suggest that moda /f_inil may be an option when stimulant response is limited. Regardless of your 
choice, don’t expect the robust and rapid response frequently seen with stimulants.
Some studies have demonstrated small improvements in ADHD symptoms with higher doses of omega-3, speci /f_ically 
eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), as a supplement; however, this has not been consistently supported in meta-analyses. Limited 
evidence also exists for ginkgo biloba and sa ﬀron in reducing ADHD symptoms. While these should not replace the use of a 
stimulant or non-stimulant medication, they may be useful as an adjunct and for families who are not currently interested in 
medication options.
Lastly, the FDA approved a medical device, the Monarch external trigeminal nerve stimulation (eTNS) system, for children 
7–12 years of age based o ﬀ a single small four-week study. The cost remains signi /f_icant for an option that lacks solid data. 
There is also an FDA-approved videogame called EndeavorRx for treatment of ADHD. Wonders never cease.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
STIMULANT SIDE EFFECTS AND CLASS WARNINGS (CHILD MEDICATION)
 /uni2981The most common side e ﬀects include appetite suppression and insomnia. With long-term use, due to chronic appetite 
suppression and acute growth hormone inhibition, some literature has reported an average decrease of half an inch 
in expected height, while several studies have not found signi /f_icant di ﬀerences with longer-term follow-up or “drug 
holidays. ” Despite this, drug holidays are still useful on weekends and school breaks for patients who struggle with 
appropriate weight gain, assuming their behavioral functioning remains manageable without medication. Taking 
stimulant medication with or after breakfast, providing snacks throughout the day, and scheduling a high-caloric evening 
snack when appetite has bounced back can help to manage appetite suppression, related irritability, and weight loss. 
High-caloric and protein milkshakes or smoothies with some combination of Ensure, whole milk, yogurt, milk powder, 
fruit, peanut butter, and ice cream can be on the menu. Cyproheptadine is sometimes used, but studies are limited. 
Additionally, stimulants should be avoided in patients with anorexia nervosa given their GI and anorectic side e ﬀects.
 /uni2981Stimulants have been known to unmask underlying tics, and at times they can exacerbate an established Tourette’s or tic 
disorder. To complicate matters further, most children present for ADHD treatment during the age range when tics begin 
to manifest and worsen. For patients with more severe tics, alpha-agonists are worth considering prior to a stimulant trial.
 /uni2981In patients with a seizure disorder, stimulants may lower the seizure threshold, although the current data are 
contradictory.
ADHD Medications
In patients with a genetic predisposition to or history of psychosis, stimulants can exacerbate symptoms in a dose-
dependent fashion. Amphetamine products have at least double the psychosis risk of methylphenidate products.
 /uni2981Patients with a comorbid anxiety disorder may experience a worsening of anxiety symptoms; however, anxiety and also 
boredom may improve.
 /uni2981Research has debunked prior concerns that stimulants might not work as well and produce more side e ﬀects in autistic 
children and teens.
 /uni2981Some patients have been known to have increased skin picking, hair pulling, and nail biting behaviors with stimulant 
medications. Alpha-agonists may be helpful here too.
 /uni2981A few patients may experience an increase in aggressive behaviors or other adverse psychiatric e ﬀects (hallucinations, 
delusions, mania).
 /uni2981Stimulants may increase heart rate and blood pressure, particularly in older patients; thus, vitals should be monitored at 
baseline and with subsequent dose adjustments. Blood pressure parameters vary in children by age, height, and sex (see 
Appendix C). Patients with cardiovascular symptoms, with a family history of early cardiac death or cardiac arrhythmias, 
or who are adopted with unknown family histories would bene /f_it from additional consultation from their primary care 
physician or cardiologist.
 /uni2981Black box warnings for abuse and dependence: Patients with a history of recent substance use should be followed more 
closely if stimulants are considered, given the risk of diversion, overuse, and dependence of these medications. Vyvanse is 
thought to have decreased misuse potential due to being a prodrug that becomes active only after oral ingestion.

 /uni2981Avoid use with MAOIs. Exercise caution with /uni00A02D6 /uni00A0inhibitors such as /f_luoxetine, paroxetine, and quinidine (increased 
atomoxetine serum levels); use slower titration and do not exceed /uni00A080/uni00A0mg/day in presence of /uni00A02D6 /uni00A0inhibitors or in /uni00A02D6 /uni00A0poor 
metabolizers.
EVIDENCE AND CLINICAL PEARLS:
 /uni2981Eﬀective and FDA approved for ADHD; however, several studies clearly show it does not produce as robust of a treatment 
eﬀect as stimulants.
 /uni2981QAM dosing is as e ﬀective as BID, but BID dosing has better GI tolerability. Can also be dosed at bedtime if it causes 
fatigue.
 /uni2981Appears to be more e ﬀective in improving attention than in controlling hyperactivity.
 /uni2981Of the two NRIs available for ADHD, atomoxetine is cheaper than viloxazine.
FUN FACT:
Atomoxetine was originally known as “tomoxetine”; however, the FDA requested that the name be changed because the 
similarity to “tamoxifen” could lead to dispensing errors.

CLONIDINE  (Catapres, Kapvay) Fact Sheet [G]
BOTTOM LINE:
Clonidine is a good option in kids with ADHD who also have tics, who experience excessive anxiety or insomnia on 
stimulants, or in whom substance misuse is a concern. Its delayed onset of e ﬀect (two to four /uni00A0weeks) and lower e ﬃcacy 
rates make it a second-line choice for ADHD generally; however, it can also be used as an add-on to stimulant medication. 
Commonly used o ﬀ label for anxiety and insomnia, but e ﬃcacy data are limited.

 /uni2981Avoid use with MAOIs. Additive e ﬀects with other antihypertensives. Caution with 2D6 inhibitors (eg, paroxetine, 
/f_luoxetine, duloxetine).
EVIDENCE AND CLINICAL PEARLS:
 /uni2981Studies support the use of clonidine to decrease residual hyperactivity, impulsivity, and aggression in ADHD.
 /uni2981Several small limited (chart review, case series, descriptive, or retrospective) studies have supported the e ﬃcacy of 
clonidine as a sleep aid in autistic kids as well as children with and without ADHD, developmental delays, and genetic 
syndromes; however, a small systematic chart review showed signi /f_icant subjective improvement in sleep in children, but 
only a nonsigni /f_icant trend for improvement of sleep in adolescents.
 /uni2981Avoid abrupt discontinuation because of potential risk for rebound hypertension. When discontinuing, taper in no more 
than 0.1 /uni00A0mg/day decrements every /uni00A0three to seven days to reduce the risk of rebound hypertension. If a child misses /uni00A0two /uni00A0or 
more consecutive doses, consider repeating titration.
 /uni2981Although a few studies support use of the patch for treating tic disorders, the patch formulation is not typically used 
except for treating hypertension because its e ﬀects on BP may be prolonged and continue even after patch removal.
 /uni2981Many child psychiatrists prefer clonidine as an agent for sleep, but little empirical evidence exists to support this use. 
Still, anecdotal clinical experience suggests clonidine is generally safe and e ﬀective for insomnia, particularly in kids with 
ADHD.
 /uni2981Generally more sedating than guanfacine.
FUN FACT:
In the early /uni00A01960s, Boehringer Ingelheim wished to synthesize a peripherally active adrenergic drug for nasal decongestion 
as nose drops. After administering the potential compound to a secretary, she fell asleep for /uni00A024/uni00A0hours, developing low blood 
pressure, low pulse, and dry mouth. This compound was subsequently developed as clonidine for treating hypertension.

and /uni00A050% about /uni00A0/f_ive/uni00A0hours later. Azstarys t ½: 6–12 hours; delivers 30% d-MPH immediately and 70% as prodrug.
 /uni2981Avoid use with MAOIs.
EVIDENCE AND CLINICAL PEARLS:
 /uni2981Several randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses have shown dexmethylphenidate, like other stimulants, is 
eﬀective for ADHD with a large treatment e ﬀect size.
 /uni2981Focalin is the d-isomer of methylphenidate and is /uni00A0twice as potent as methylphenidate, which is why it is prescribed at 
about half the dose. Serdex-MPH is a prodrug, converted to d-MPH in the lower GI tract.
 /uni2981Use the same total daily dose of Focalin IR as Focalin XR. The combined dose of Azstarys 26.1/5.2, 39.2/7.8, or 52.3/10.4 mg 
is equivalent to 20, 30, or 40 mg of Focalin, respectively.
 /uni2981Focalin XR capsules contain /uni00A0two /uni00A0kinds of beads: Half are immediate-release beads and half are enteric-coated delayed-
release beads. A single, once-daily dose of XR capsule provides the same amount of dexmethylphenidate as /uni00A0two /uni00A0IR tablets 
given /uni00A0four /uni00A0hours apart.
 /uni2981The ER capsules cannot be split in half. However, they can be opened and the beads sprinkled over food. The patient 
should then eat all that food—eating half won’t work to split the dose accurately because it won’t be possible to 
determine if the eaten portion contains more immediate-release or delayed-release beads.
 /uni2981Give with food if GI side e ﬀects occur.
FUN FACT:
With /uni00A0two /uni00A0stereoactive centers, methylphenidate has /uni00A0four /uni00A0possible stereoisomers. Of the /uni00A0four, dexmethylphenidate is the 
most active biologically.

MONITORING:  Weight, height, BP/P; ECG.
COST:  IR/ER: $ (ProCentra: $$$)
SIDE EFFECTS:
 /uni2981Most common: Abdominal pain, anorexia, nausea, tics, insomnia, tachycardia, headache.
 /uni2981Serious but rare: See class warnings in chapter introduction.
MECHANISM, PHARMACOKINETICS, AND DRUG INTERACTIONS:
 /uni2981Stimulant that inhibits reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine.
 /uni2981Metabolized primarily through CYP450 2D6 (minor) and glucuronidation; t ½: 12/uni00A0hours.
 /uni2981Avoid use with MAOIs, antacids.
EVIDENCE AND CLINICAL PEARLS:
 /uni2981At least /uni00A0/f_ive/uni00A0randomized clinical trials, some dating back to the /uni00A01970s, support the e ﬃcacy of dextroamphetamine in 
children with ADHD.
 /uni2981Dextroamphetamine is the more potent d-isomer of amphetamine; it has potentially less peripheral e ﬀects (eg, motor tics) 
than racemic mix (eg, mixed amphetamine salts like Adderall, amphetamine, or methamphetamine).
 /uni2981Doses of IR tablets and oral solution can be given at intervals of /uni00A0four to six hours.
 /uni2981Dextroamphetamine is the only stimulant, other than Adderall IR, approved for children <6 /uni00A0years (approved for children 
>3/uni00A0years).
 /uni2981The newer Zenzedi brand o ﬀers more dosing /f_lexibility options, but is more expensive than generic IR tablets.

FUN FACT:
Dexys Midnight Runners, the British band famous for its song “Come On Eileen” (1982), derived their name from 
Dexedrine—“Dexys” after the drug’s name and “Midnight Runners” in reference to the energy it provides.
ADHD Medications
 www.thecarlatreport.com  | CHILD MEDICATION FACT BOOK FOR PSYCHIATRIC PRACTICE, SECOND EDITION   25DEXTROAMPHETAMINE  TRANSDERMAL  (Xelstrym) Fact Sheet
BOTTOM LINE:
A patch option in the amphetamine class of stimulants for kids who cannot use the wide array of oral stimulants available 
today. Minimal data and less experience than with methylphenidate transdermal (Daytrana), but similar to Daytrana in terms 
of high cost, lag time for onset of e ﬀect, and side e ﬀects.
PEDIATRIC FDA INDICATIONS:
ADHD (6–17 /uni00A0years).
ADULT FDA INDICATIONS:
ADHD.
DOSAGE FORMS:
Transdermal patch:  4.5/uni00A0mg, 9 /uni00A0mg, 13.5 /uni00A0mg, 18 /uni00A0mg/9 /uni00A0hour.
PEDIATRIC DOSAGE GUIDANCE:
Start /uni00A04.5/uni00A0mg/9 /uni00A0hour patch QAM (for initial therapy or for patients switching from other amphetamine preparations, 
regardless of dose). Apply to hip, upper arm, chest, upper back, or /f_lank/uni00A0two /uni00A0hours before an e ﬀect is needed and 
remove /uni00A0nine /uni00A0hours after application (drug e ﬀects may persist for /uni00A0/f_ive/uni00A0hours after removal). Increase dose at weekly intervals 
by using next-higher-dose system. May be removed in <9 /uni00A0hours if shorter duration is desired or if late-day side e ﬀects occur. 
Rotate application sites. Max /uni00A018/uni00A0mg QD.
MONITORING:  Weight, height, BP/P; ECG.
COST:  $$$$
SIDE EFFECTS:
 /uni2981Most common: Decreased appetite, headache, insomnia, tic, abdominal pain, vomiting, nausea, irritability, increased BP 
and pulse. Application site reactions and sensitization may occur.
 /uni2981Serious but rare: See class warnings in chapter introduction.
MECHANISM, PHARMACOKINETICS, AND DRUG INTERACTIONS:
 /uni2981Stimulant that inhibits reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine.
 /uni2981Metabolized primarily through CYP450 2D6 (minor) and glucuronidation; t ½: 6.4 /uni00A0hours (11.5 hours in adults).
 /uni2981Avoid use with MAOIs, antacids.
EVIDENCE AND CLINICAL PEARLS:
 /uni2981Approval was based on a two-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover, modi /f_ied-analog classroom 
study in 110 pediatric patients with ADHD ages 6–17. E ﬃcacy measure assessed was the Swanson, Kotkin, Angler, M. 
Flynn, and Pelham (SKAMP) score, a scale speci /f_ic to the classroom setting.
 /uni2981Dextroamphetamine is the more potent d-isomer of amphetamine; it has potentially less peripheral e ﬀects (eg, motor tics) 
than racemic mix (eg, mixed amphetamine salts like Adderall, amphetamine, or methamphetamine).
 /uni2981The manufacturer, Noven Pharmaceuticals, Inc. recommends against cutting the patch (eg to adjust the dosage).
FUN FACT: 
While Daytrana is approved for pediatric use only, Xelstrym is also approved for use in adults.
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
GUANFACINE  (Intuniv, Tenex) Fact Sheet [G]
BOTTOM LINE:
Guanfacine’s advantages over stimulants include no worsening of tic disorders, lack of misuse potential, and no insomnia. It 
can also be used as an add-on to stimulant medication. However, its delayed onset of e ﬀect (two to four weeks) and lower 
eﬃcacy rates make it a second-line choice for ADHD generally. ER is now available in generic and easier to use than IR. 
Commonly used o ﬀ label for anxiety and insomnia, but e ﬃcacy data are limited.
PEDIATRIC FDA INDICATIONS:
ADHD  (6–17 /uni00A0years [ER formulation only]), as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy to stimulants.
ADULT FDA INDICATIONS:
Hypertension.
OFF /hyphen.capLABEL USES:
Conduct disorder; Tourette’s and motor tics; agitation in autistic kids; migraine prophylaxis; opioid withdrawal; anxiety and 
PTSD; insomnia.
DOSAGE FORMS:
 /uni2981IR tablets (Tenex, [G]):  1/uni00A0mg, 2 /uni00A0mg.
 /uni2981ER tablets (Intuniv, [G]):  1/uni00A0mg, 2 /uni00A0mg, 3 /uni00A0mg, 4 /uni00A0mg.
PEDIATRIC DOSAGE GUIDANCE:
 /uni2981ADHD or anxiety:
 –IR dosing depends on weight:
 /uni25FD27–40.5 /uni00A0kg (55–90 /uni00A0lbs): Start /uni00A00.5/uni00A0mg QHS, ↑ by/uni00A00.5/uni00A0mg/
day at weekly intervals up to /uni00A01.5/uni00A0mg/day; may ↑ 
to/uni00A02/uni00A0mg/day after /uni00A0two /uni00A0weeks; max /uni00A02/uni00A0mg/day in /uni00A0two to 
four divided doses. /uni25FD40.5–45 /uni00A0kg (90–99 /uni00A0lbs): Start /uni00A00.5/uni00A0mg QHS, ↑ by/uni00A00.5/uni00A0mg/
day at weekly intervals; max /uni00A01/uni00A0mg per dose, 3 /uni00A0mg/day.
 /uni25FD>45 /uni00A0kg (>99 /uni00A0lbs): Start /uni00A01/uni00A0mg QHS, ↑ by/uni00A01/uni00A0mg/day at 
weekly intervals up to /uni00A03/uni00A0mg/day; may ↑ to/uni00A04/uni00A0mg/day 
after /uni00A0two /uni00A0weeks; max /uni00A01/uni00A0mg per dose, 4 /uni00A0mg/day.
 –ER: Start /uni00A01/uni00A0mg QHS, ↑ by/uni00A01/uni00A0mg/day at weekly intervals; max /uni00A04/uni00A0mg/day. Alternative: 0.05–0.12 /uni00A0mg/kg QD or QHS; 
max /uni00A04/uni00A0mg/day. Doses up to /uni00A07/uni00A0mg/day ER studied as monotherapy in adolescents.
 /uni2981Insomnia: Use IR: Start low, go slow, typically 0.5 mg QHS, increasing by 0.5 mg/day at weekly intervals; max 3 mg/day.
MONITORING:  BP .
COST:  $
SIDE EFFECTS:
 /uni2981Most common: Dry mouth, somnolence, dizziness, constipation, fatigue, headache.
 /uni2981Serious but rare: Hypotension, syncope, orthostasis.
MECHANISM, PHARMACOKINETICS, AND DRUG INTERACTIONS:
 /uni2981Centrally acting, selective alpha-2 /uni00A0adrenergic agonist.
 /uni2981Metabolized primarily through CYP3A4; t ½: 13–14 /uni00A0hours in children (16–18 /uni00A0hours in adults).
 /uni2981Avoid use with MAOIs. Caution with /uni00A03A4 /uni00A0inhibitors (eg, clarithromycin, /f_luvoxamine) and inducers (eg, St. John’s wort, 
carbamazepine).
EVIDENCE AND CLINICAL PEARLS:
 /uni2981At least /uni00A0six/uni00A0randomized placebo-controlled trials and a meta-analysis show e ﬃcacy in children with ADHD.
 /uni2981A pilot study of /uni00A083/uni00A0children with GAD, separation anxiety, or social anxiety found guanfacine treatment resulted in greater 
subjective improvement of anxiety than placebo, but no improvement on other measures of anxiety.
 /uni2981One negative randomized trial for insomnia in children with ADHD found decreased total sleep time of nearly an hour, 
with kids taking more time to fall asleep.
 /uni2981Guanfacine IR and ER are not interchangeable on a mg:mg basis. When switching, taper and retitrate.
 /uni2981Guanfacine tends to be less sedating than clonidine, another alpha-agonist.
 /uni2981ER tablets should not be taken with a high-fat meal due to increased medication exposure.
 /uni2981Minimize side e ﬀects, especially somnolence, by administering at bedtime.
 /uni2981Monitor BP , especially during initial dosing titration.
 /uni2981There is a risk of nervousness, anxiety, and possibly rebound hypertension /uni00A0two to four /uni00A0days after abrupt discontinuation. 
Taper dose in /uni00A01/uni00A0mg/day decrements every /uni00A0three to seven days.
 /uni2981If a child misses /uni00A0two /uni00A0or more consecutive doses, consider repeating titration.
FUN FACT:
Some prescribers have taken advantage of guanfacine’s sympatholytic properties for the treatment of anxiety disorders in 
children as well as nightmares and dissociative symptoms in PTSD.
ADHD Medications
 www.thecarlatreport.com  | CHILD MEDICATION FACT BOOK FOR PSYCHIATRIC PRACTICE, SECOND EDITION   27LISDEXAMFETAMINE  (Vyvanse) Fact Sheet
BOTTOM LINE:
Vyvanse may have a gentler, “smoother” side e ﬀect pro /f_ile than other amphetamines, and probably has a lower risk of 
diversion or misuse. However, its high cost means insurance companies don’t like to pay for it without prior authorizations.
PEDIATRIC FDA INDICATIONS:
ADHD  (6–17 /uni00A0years).
ADULT FDA INDICATIONS:
ADHD; binge eating disorder (BED).
OFF /hyphen.capLABEL USES:
Narcolepsy; obesity; treatment-resistant depression.
DOSAGE FORMS:
 /uni2981Capsules:  10/uni00A0mg, 20 /uni00A0mg, 30 /uni00A0mg, 40 /uni00A0mg, 50 /uni00A0mg, 60 /uni00A0mg, 70 /uni00A0mg.
 /uni2981Chewable tablets:  10/uni00A0mg, 20 /uni00A0mg, 30 /uni00A0mg, 40 /uni00A0mg, 50 /uni00A0mg, 60 /uni00A0mg.
PEDIATRIC DOSAGE GUIDANCE:
Start /uni00A030/uni00A0mg QAM, ↑ by/uni00A010–20 /uni00A0mg/day at weekly intervals. Target lowest e ﬀective dose; max /uni00A070/uni00A0mg/day.
MONITORING:  Weight, height, BP/P; ECG.
COST:  $$$$
SIDE EFFECTS:
 /uni2981Most common: Insomnia, anorexia, abdominal pain, irritability, agitation, tics, decreased appetite, increased heart rate, 
jitteriness, anxiety.
 /uni2981Serious but rare: See class warnings in chapter introduction.
MECHANISM, PHARMACOKINETICS, AND DRUG INTERACTIONS:
 /uni2981Stimulant that inhibits reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine.
 /uni2981Metabolized primarily through non-CYP-mediated hepatic and/or intestinal metabolism; t ½: lisdexamfetamine (inactive 
prodrug) <1 /uni00A0hour; dextroamphetamine (active metabolite) 12 /uni00A0hours. Dextroamphetamine metabolized by CYP2D6.
 /uni2981Avoid use with MAOIs and antacids. Caution with antihypertensives (decreased e ﬃcacy of antihypertensive). Caution 
with /uni00A02D6 /uni00A0inhibitors, which may increase stimulant e ﬀects.
EVIDENCE AND CLINICAL PEARLS:
 /uni2981At least /f_ive randomized controlled trials and a meta-analysis support e ﬃcacy of lisdexamfetamine in children with ADHD.
 /uni2981Lisdexamfetamine is dextroamphetamine with the chemical lysine bound to it, which renders it inactive. It remains 
inactive until GI enzymes cleave o ﬀ lysine and convert it to active dextroamphetamine. This means that people who 
misuse it can’t get high by snorting it or injecting it.
 /uni2981Anecdotally, Vyvanse has a more gradual onset and o ﬀset than other stimulants, and may cause fewer side e ﬀects than 
other amphetamines.
 /uni2981Taking with food decreases the e ﬀect slightly and delays peak levels by an hour. If patients feel it’s not “kicking in” fast 
enough, have them take it earlier or on an empty stomach.
 /uni2981Lisdexamfetamine /uni00A070/uni00A0mg is equivalent to /uni00A030/uni00A0mg of mixed amphetamine salts (Adderall).
 /uni2981While indicated for BED, it is not approved for use as a weight-loss or anti-obesity agent, nor has it been studied in 
children.
FUN FACT:
The manufacturer of Vyvanse pursued an indication as an add-on medication for depression, but disappointing results in 
clinical trials put an end to this e ﬀort.
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
METHAMPHETAMINE  (Desoxyn) Fact Sheet [G]
BOTTOM LINE:
Highly addictive substance; its use is generally not recommended. Watch the television show Breaking Bad  if you’re not 
convinced!
PEDIATRIC FDA INDICATIONS:
ADHD  (6–17 /uni00A0years); obesity  (12–17 /uni00A0years).
ADULT FDA INDICATIONS:
Obesity.
DOSAGE FORMS:
Tablets (G):  5/uni00A0mg.
PEDIATRIC DOSAGE GUIDANCE:
ADHD: Start /uni00A05/uni00A0mg QAM–BID, ↑ by/uni00A05/uni00A0mg/day at weekly intervals to max /uni00A020/uni00A0mg/day, divided BID.
MONITORING:  Weight, height, BP/P; ECG.
COST:  $$$$
SIDE EFFECTS:
 /uni2981Most common: Anorexia, tachycardia, dizziness, insomnia, tremor, tics, restlessness, headache, constipation (decreased GI 
motility). Dental complications, such as poor dental hygiene, di ﬀuse cavities, bruxism, and tooth wear, may develop with 
misuse.
 /uni2981Serious but rare: See class warnings in chapter introduction.
MECHANISM, PHARMACOKINETICS, AND DRUG INTERACTIONS:
 /uni2981Stimulant that inhibits reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine.
 /uni2981Metabolized primarily through CYP2D6 /uni00A0to active metabolite (amphetamine); t ½: 4–5 /uni00A0hours.
 /uni2981Avoid use with MAOIs and antacids. Caution with /uni00A02D6 /uni00A0inhibitors, which may increase stimulant e ﬀects.
EVIDENCE AND CLINICAL PEARLS:
 /uni2981FDA indication, but very limited published data in children.
 /uni2981High risk of misuse.
 /uni2981Not widely used (DEA reports that there were only /uni00A016,000 /uni00A0prescriptions written in /uni00A02012). When prescribed for obesity, 
the recommendation is for short-term (ie, a few weeks) use only and as an adjunct to caloric restriction due to its high 
addiction and diversion potential.
 /uni2981CNS stimulating e ﬀect is approximately equal to or greater than that of amphetamine but less than that of 
dextroamphetamine; less BP elevation than with amphetamine.
FUN FACTS:
Desoxyn is the same as the abused street drug methamphetamine, just pharmaceutical grade. Although methamphetamine 
and amphetamine were long thought to be available only via laboratories, methamphetamine has been reported to occur 
naturally in certain acacia trees that grow in West Texas.

 /uni2981Serious but rare: See class warnings in chapter introduction.
MECHANISM, PHARMACOKINETICS, AND DRUG INTERACTIONS:
 /uni2981Stimulant that inhibits reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine.
 /uni2981Hepatic metabolism via carboxylesterase CES1A1, not CYP450 /uni00A0isoenzymes; t ½: 2–4 /uni00A0hours.
 /uni2981Avoid use with MAOIs, antacids.
EVIDENCE AND CLINICAL PEARLS:
 /uni2981FDA approved with many studies and long history of clinical use supporting its e ﬃcacy and safety, with a larger treatment 
eﬀect size than non-stimulant medications.
 /uni2981Methylphenidate generally causes fewer side e ﬀects than amphetamine preparations—patients are less likely to report 
feeling “wired.”
 /uni2981While all stimulants may unmask tics, a Cochrane review of /uni00A0eight /uni00A0randomized trials showed that methylphenidate did not 
worsen tics in children with ADHD and a tic disorder; in some cases it even improved tics.
 /uni2981Methylin chewable tablet: Administer with at least /uni00A08/uni00A0ounces of water or other /f_luid.
FUN FACT:
Methylphenidate was synthesized by Ciba (now Novartis) chemist Leandro Panizzon. His wife, Marguerite, had low blood 
pressure and would take the stimulant before playing tennis. He named the substance “Ritaline” (yes, with the “e” on the end) 
after his wife’s nickname, Rita.

COST:  $$; Aptensio XR, Cotempla XR-ODT, Concerta, Jornay PM, Quillivant XR, and Quillichew ER: $$$$
SIDE EFFECTS AND MECHANISM, MONITORING, PHARMACOKINETICS, AND DRUG INTERACTIONS:
Weight, height, BP/P; ECG. See methylphenidate IR fact sheet.
EVIDENCE AND CLINICAL PEARLS:
 /uni2981FDA approved with many studies and long history of clinical use supporting its e ﬃcacy and safety, with a larger treatment 
eﬀect size than non-stimulant medications.
 /uni2981ER capsules contain mixture of /uni00A030% IR and /uni00A070% ER beads. Aptensio XR, a new branded formulation of ER capsules, 
contains a mixture of /uni00A040% IR and /uni00A060% ER beads. Ritalin LA and its generic ER capsules are a combination of /uni00A050% IR 
and /uni00A050% DR beads. These products mimic BID dosing of IR. Cotempla delivers a mixture of 25% IR and 75% ER in an orally 
disintegrating extended-release formulation. Jornay PM is dosed in evening; if early-morning awakening occurs, dose 
earlier in evening.
 /uni2981Concerta is based on the OROS osmotic delivery system (also used for Invega). 22% of the dose is immediate (with e ﬀects 
in/uni00A0one to two /uni00A0hours) and /uni00A078% is delayed. If you prescribe a generic, you may need to investigate carefully to ensure that 
the delivery system is an OROS pump system. To avoid insomnia, dosing should be completed by noon.
ADHD Medications
 www.thecarlatreport.com  | CHILD MEDICATION FACT BOOK FOR PSYCHIATRIC PRACTICE, SECOND EDITION   31METHYLPHENIDATE  TRANSDERMAL  (Daytrana) Fact Sheet
BOTTOM LINE:
Daytrana is helpful for kids who, for whatever reason, cannot use any of the wide variety of oral stimulant preparations. 
Otherwise, we don’t recommend it due to high cost, lag time for onset of e ﬀect, and the side e ﬀect of rash, which is pretty 
common and unpleasant.
PEDIATRIC FDA INDICATIONS:
ADHD  (6–17 /uni00A0years).
ADULT FDA INDICATIONS:
ADHD.
DOSAGE FORMS:
Transdermal patch:  10/uni00A0mg, 15 /uni00A0mg, 20 /uni00A0mg, 30 /uni00A0mg/9 /uni00A0hour.
PEDIATRIC DOSAGE GUIDANCE:
Start /uni00A010/uni00A0mg/9 /uni00A0hour patch QAM (for initial therapy or for patients switching from other methylphenidate preparations, 
regardless of dose). Apply to hip /uni00A0two /uni00A0hours before an e ﬀect is needed and remove /uni00A0nine /uni00A0hours after application (drug e ﬀects 
may persist for /uni00A0/f_ive/uni00A0hours after removal). Increase dose at weekly intervals by using next-higher-dose system. May be 
removed in <9 /uni00A0hours if shorter duration is desired or if late-day side e ﬀects occur. Rotate application sites. Max /uni00A030/uni00A0mg QD.
MONITORING:  Weight, height, BP/P; ECG.
COST:  $$$
SIDE EFFECTS:
 /uni2981Most common: Headache, insomnia, irritability, decreased appetite, anorexia, nausea, tics, application site reaction 
(10%–40% incidence in children).
 /uni2981Serious but rare: Allergic contact dermatitis/sensitization, characterized by intense local reactions (eg, edema, papules) 
that may spread beyond patch site; sensitization may subsequently manifest systemically with other routes of 
methylphenidate administration.
MECHANISM, PHARMACOKINETICS, AND DRUG INTERACTIONS:
 /uni2981Stimulant that inhibits reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine.
 /uni2981Hepatic metabolism via carboxylesterase CES1A1, not CYP450 /uni00A0isoenzymes; t ½: 3–4 /uni00A0hours.
 /uni2981Avoid use with MAOIs, antacids.
EVIDENCE AND CLINICAL PEARLS:
 /uni2981FDA approved with several studies supporting its e ﬃcacy and safety, with a larger treatment e ﬀect size than non-
stimulant medications, including in preschoolers (albeit no FDA indication for this age group).
 /uni2981Apply patch to clean, dry area of the hip; don’t apply to waistline or to areas under tight clothes, as it may rub o ﬀ. 
Alternate sites daily (eg, opposite hip). Absorption not a ﬀected by perspiration. Remove after /uni00A0nine /uni00A0hours. If dislodged, 
replace with a new patch but remove within the /uni00A0nine-hour total wear time.
 /uni2981Clinical e ﬀect usually seen in /uni00A0two /uni00A0hours and lasts approximately /uni00A012/uni00A0hours.
 /uni2981Exposure of application site to a heat source (eg, hair dryer, heating pad, electric blanket) may increase the amount of 
drug absorbed.
 /uni2981For localized skin reactions (redness at site), use cortisone cream (1%–2%). For persistent, severe, or systemic reactions, 
discontinue patch.
 /uni2981In June /uni00A02015, the FDA added a warning that Daytrana can cause chemical leukoderma, a permanent loss of skin color. 
These reactions are irreversible and not harmful but can be dis /f_iguring to patients. Instruct patients to contact their 
physician if they notice skin color changes or lightening of skin areas; in such cases, an alternative medication should be 
considered.
 /uni2981The manufacturer recommends to not cut the patch as it may release medication inconsistently or too quickly.
FUN FACT:
Since /uni00A02006, Shire Pharmaceuticals has issued at least /uni00A010/uni00A0recalls of Daytrana patches because users have had di ﬃculty 
removing the protective cover from the patch. Recall costs have reached into the millions.

MIXED  AMPHETAMINE  SALTS  (Adderall, Adderall XR, Mydayis) Fact Sheet [G]
BOTTOM LINE:
Adderall is e ﬀective but is probably the most misused and diverted of all stimulants, and it tends to have more side e ﬀects, 
all of which is why we recommend starting most patients on methylphenidate instead.
PEDIATRIC FDA INDICATIONS:
ADHD  (3–17 /uni00A0years for IR, 6–17 /uni00A0years for XR, 13–17 /uni00A0years for Mydayis); narcolepsy  (6–17 /uni00A0years).
ADULT FDA INDICATIONS:
ADHD; narcolepsy.
OFF /hyphen.capLABEL USES:
Obesity; treatment-resistant depression.
DOSAGE FORMS:
 /uni2981Tablets (Adderall, [G]):  5/uni00A0mg, 7.5 /uni00A0mg, 10 /uni00A0mg, 12.5 /uni00A0mg, 15 /uni00A0mg, 20 /uni00A0mg, 30 /uni00A0mg.
 /uni2981ER capsules (Adderall XR, [G]):  5/uni00A0mg, 10 /uni00A0mg, 15 /uni00A0mg, 20 /uni00A0mg, 25 /uni00A0mg, 30 /uni00A0mg.
 /uni2981ER capsules (Mydayis):  12.5 /uni00A0mg, 25 /uni00A0mg, 37.5 /uni00A0mg, 50 /uni00A0mg.
PEDIATRIC DOSAGE GUIDANCE:
 /uni2981ADHD:
 –For IR and ER Adderall and its generic equivalent preparation. Initial dose should be /uni00A00.3/uni00A0mg/kg/day, but shoot for a 
target dose of /uni00A01.0/uni00A0mg/kg/day and maximum dose of /uni00A02/uni00A0mg/kg/day.
 –IR (ages /uni00A03–5): Start /uni00A02.5/uni00A0mg QAM, increase by /uni00A02.5/uni00A0mg/day increments in weekly intervals, max /uni00A040/uni00A0mg/day divided BID.
 –IR (ages /uni00A06–17): Start /uni00A05/uni00A0mg QAM or BID, increase by /uni00A05/uni00A0mg/day increments in weekly intervals, max /uni00A040/uni00A0mg/day divided BID.
 –ER (ages /uni00A06–12): Start /uni00A05–10 /uni00A0mg QAM, increase by /uni00A05–10 /uni00A0mg/day increments weekly, 30 /uni00A0mg/day.
 –ER (ages /uni00A013–17): Start /uni00A010/uni00A0mg QAM, increase by /uni00A010/uni00A0mg/day increments weekly, max /uni00A040/uni00A0mg/day QAM in adolescents.
 –Mydayis (adolescents /uni00A013–17 /uni00A0years): Start /uni00A012.5 /uni00A0mg QAM, increase in increments of /uni00A012.5 /uni00A0mg/day weekly, max /uni00A025/uni00A0mg/day.
 /uni2981Narcolepsy: Start /uni00A05/uni00A0mg QAM (ages /uni00A06–11) or /uni00A010/uni00A0mg QAM (ages /uni00A012–17), increase by /uni00A05/uni00A0mg/day (ages /uni00A06–11) or /uni00A010/uni00A0mg/day 
(ages /uni00A012–17) at weekly increments, max /uni00A060/uni00A0mg/day.
MONITORING:  Weight, height, BP/P; ECG.
COST:  IR/ER: $; Mydayis: $$$$
SIDE EFFECTS:
 /uni2981Most common: Insomnia, headache, decreased appetite, abdominal pain, weight loss, agitation.
 /uni2981Serious but rare: See class warnings in chapter introduction.
MECHANISM, PHARMACOKINETICS, AND DRUG INTERACTIONS:
 /uni2981Stimulant that inhibits reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine.
 /uni2981Metabolized primarily through CYP2D6; t ½: 9–14 /uni00A0hours. Duration of action: 6–8 /uni00A0hours (IR), 8–12 /uni00A0hours (XR).
 /uni2981Avoid use with MAOIs, antacids. Caution with /uni00A02D6 /uni00A0inhibitors, which may increase stimulant e ﬀects.
EVIDENCE AND CLINICAL PEARLS:
 /uni2981FDA approved with many studies and long history of clinical use supporting its e ﬃcacy and safety, with a larger treatment 
eﬀect size than non-stimulant medications.
 /uni2981Each dose contains a mixture of amphetamine salts, resulting in a /uni00A075:25 /uni00A0ratio of dextro and levo isomers of amphetamine.
 /uni2981When converting from IR to ER, use the same total daily dose, given QAM.
 /uni2981Adderall may provide more of a “kick” than methylphenidate preparations. Roughly twice as potent (per mg) as 
methylphenidate.
 /uni2981Mydayis is formulated with pH-dependent drug-releasing beads, with immediate-release beads and delayed-release 
beads that release drug at pH /uni00A05.5/uni00A0and pH /uni00A07.0. Duration of e ﬀect may be up to /uni00A016/uni00A0hours.
 /uni2981Dextroamphetamine and mixed amphetamine salts are the only stimulants approved for children <6 /uni00A0years (approved for 
children >3 /uni00A0years), with the exception of Mydayis, which causes very high rates of side e ﬀects (insomnia, reduced appetite) 
in children <13 /uni00A0years and should only be used in children ≥13/uni00A0years.
FUN FACTS:
Was brie /f_ly pulled from the market in Canada in /uni00A02005 /uni00A0because of cardiac concerns, and now counterfeit Adderall is a 
common vehicle for overdose and death due to adulteration with fentanyl or methamphetamine.
ADHD Medications
 www.thecarlatreport.com  | CHILD MEDICATION FACT BOOK FOR PSYCHIATRIC PRACTICE, SECOND EDITION   33VILOXAZINE  XR (Qelbree) Fact Sheet
BOTTOM LINE:
Like the /f_irst norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor for ADHD, atomoxetine, viloxazine has no misuse potential and is less likely 
than stimulants to cause insomnia, anxiety, or tics. However, it is generally less e ﬀective than stimulants and takes longer to 
work. While viloxazine may work faster than atomoxetine, it’s unclear if it has any advantage, and unlike atomoxetine, there’s 
no option for a cheaper generic.
PEDIATRIC FDA INDICATIONS:
ADHD  (6–17 /uni00A0years).
ADULT FDA INDICATIONS:
ADHD.
OFF /hyphen.capLABEL USES:
Treatment-resistant depression.
DOSAGE FORMS:
ER capsules:  100 /uni00A0mg, 150 /uni00A0mg, 200 /uni00A0mg.
PEDIATRIC DOSAGE GUIDANCE:
 /uni2981Children >12: Start /uni00A0200/uni00A0mg QD, ↑ by/uni00A0200/uni00A0mg/day after one week to max 400 mg QD.
 /uni2981Children 6–11: Start /uni00A0100/uni00A0mg QD, ↑ by 100 mg/day at weekly intervals to max 400 mg QD.
MONITORING:  BP/P; baseline renal function.
COST:  $$$$
SIDE EFFECTS:
 /uni2981Most common: Somnolence, decreased appetite, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, insomnia, irritability.
 /uni2981Serious but rare: Class warning for suicidal ideation in children and teens. Mania reported. May increase pulse and BP .
MECHANISM, PHARMACOKINETICS, AND DRUG INTERACTIONS:
 /uni2981Selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (NRI).
 /uni2981Metabolized primarily via CYP2D6, UGT1A9, UGTB15; t ½: 7/uni00A0hours.
 /uni2981Avoid use with MAOIs. Strong 1A2 inhibitor; exercise caution with /uni00A01A2 /uni00A0substrates with narrow therapeutic index (eg, 
clozapine, duloxetine, ramelteon, tasimelteon, tizanidine, theophylline) as combination may increase side e ﬀects of 
substrate.
EVIDENCE AND CLINICAL PEARLS:
 /uni2981ER capsules, so do not cut, crush, or chew; can open and sprinkle contents in applesauce.
 /uni2981Adjust dose in severe renal impairment (eGFR <30 mL/min); max 200 mg/day.
 /uni2981Data from one of four studies suggest viloxazine may work a bit faster than atomoxetine (week one vs week three), but 
this /f_inding is not based on head-to-head data and it’s hard to know whether it is clinically signi /f_icant.
 /uni2981Eﬀective and FDA approved for ADHD; however, not likely to produce as robust of a treatment e ﬀect as stimulants.
 /uni2981Of the two NRIs available for ADHD, atomoxetine is cheaper than viloxazine.
FUN FACT:
Viloxazine has been studied and rejected for various indications since the 1970s and originally received an FDA orphan drug 
designation for narcolepsy.
